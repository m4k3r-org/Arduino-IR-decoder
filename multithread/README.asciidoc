= Multithreading on AVR 8 bit controllers

This is the first working example that blinks a LED. One thread turns it on the other turns it off.

Builds with current avr-gcc: see Makefile

Works on Controllino MAXI.

HW dependent settings: 
 
 * CPU Freq (UART debug line baud rate depends on it)
 * Port where LED is present in main.c
 * RAM sizes and exact pointers, pushAll, popAll ASM commands implemented as macros in multithreading-hwavr2560.h
