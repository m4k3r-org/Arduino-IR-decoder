= Quadrature decoder with SPI interface

TODO never executed - just a proof of concept

Specification:

 * Signal A change ISR takes about 30 cycles worst case (Program is in cli/sei block and pin change happens that moment)
 * Only Signal A change (0->1 and 1->0) triggers ISR
 * Full precision can be read out (changes in signal B since last ISR are read out on request)
 * Read out is triggered by Negated Chip Select
 * Read out is sent using software SPI master mode Can easily be received on Arduino and such.
 * TODO CPU clock speed is tuned to 20MHz using PLL and OSCCAL -> about 0,8MHz signal A changes can be processed. That means 1.6MHz signals on full precision.

See ASM file for further details.
