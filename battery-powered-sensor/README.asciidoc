= Low power wireless thermometer

This is a half baked project - this document logs the trials.


== Initial measurement of Attiny power usage

In sleep mode I measured 4uA at 3.13V from a lab DC power supply. This value is close to the low limit of my cheap tool so it may not be accurate. This value matches the datasheet.

== Simple radio

Works by pulsing on the send side and it is received on the other side but it also has some noise in my lab environment.
