= KiCAD PCB power line unmask processor

Extracts all power lines from the PCB design plan and copies them to the mask layers.

Can be used so that the power lines are not covered with mask and so they can be strenghten by adding some solder to their surface.

== Usage

Start the com.rizsi.kicad.KicadProcessor class as a main entry point.

First parameter must be the path .kicad_pcb file.

Best practice is to put the KiCAD desig files into version control and check the result of the program in a diff view.

Copies all traces with 1.5mm width from F.Cu and B.Cu to the F.Mask and B.Mask layers. Also removes all other 1.5mm traces form the F.Mask and B.Mask layers so a single run updates this layer totally.

If you want to use it with different filter parameters then you have to adopt the source code.
