3V - 220 mAh

Pro: no power regulation is required

Radio power usage: transmit 7-11mA
RX: settling 8.4mA, max 12mA

Approx 10h of constant transmit. We transmit 1/1000 second every minute then it is comparable to the sleep power

Sleep:

Attiny 2uA Mérés: 5uA
radio 900nA (could be powered down but it is not necessary)
Thermo 1000nA (can be easily powered off)

Together: 3uA

Sleep Battery life: 220 mAh/3uA = 220/3 * 1000 h = 73.333h = 3055 days ~= 8 years
